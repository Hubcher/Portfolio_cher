\section{Introduction}
This is the documentation for the Tetris project. The goal of this project is to create a fully functional Tetris game in C using the ncurses library.

\section{Installation}
To install the project, run the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
make install or make all
\end{verbatim}

\section{Usage}
After installation, you can run the game using the command:
\begin{verbatim}
./install_dir/tetris
\end{verbatim}

\section{Test}
You can also run tests using the command:
\begin{verbatim}
make test
\end{verbatim}

\section{Architecture}
The project is divided into two main parts: the game logic and the user interface (CLI). Game logic is responsible for managing game mechanics, while the CLI handles user input and output.
