It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:

    После напряженного рабочего дня в Hewlett-Packard ты наконец вернулся домой.

Взяв его и пачку крекеров, ты уселся в свое укромное местечко перед компьютером Dell.

It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:

Стоял обычный серый день осенью 1993 года. 
    После напряженного рабочего дня в Hewlett-Packard ты наконец вернулся домой. 
    
        У тебя небольшая двухкомнатная квартирка на окраине города N, а в холодильнике так кстати завалялась баночка слабоалкогольного напитка под названием pivo. 
        
        
        
Взяв его и пачку крекеров, ты уселся в свое укромное местечко перед компьютером Dell.

Стоял обычный серый день осенью 1993 года. 
    После напряженного рабочего дня в Hewlett-Packard ты наконец вернулся домой. 
    
        У тебя небольшая двухкомнатная квартирка на окраине города N, а в холодильнике так кстати завалялась баночка слабоалкогольного напитка под названием pivo. 
        
        
        
Взяв его и пачку крекеров, ты уселся в свое укромное местечко перед компьютером Dell.



*Щелчок* — это ты нажал кнопку включения.

It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:

It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:

It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:

It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:

    You, student, came home from work at Hewlett-Packard, feeling a little tired. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.

It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. 
            In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
	`*Click*` - the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:
